                <h3>Notes:</h3>
                <p>9 went, great to see more venturing out on the longer rides!
                    09:00 Start
                    A very varied and mixture of surfaces, different and challenging, mostly dry and hardpacked.
                    11:20 - Approx 2 hrs 20 mins to get to Guildford, 19 miles into the ride.
                    12:15 - Around 3 hrs 15 mins to Watts Gallery, 22 miles in. A lovely place to stop, the food and coffee was very good, but it took while to arrive (an hour+).
                    14:35 - 5 hrs 40 mins to Farnham....after several hills and then there was the climb out of Farnham!
                    15:50 - 6 hrs 50 mins back in Fleet...38 miles
                    No major mechanicals. It was good to see that folks were taking fuel and fluid onboard at every opportunity and it seemed to help, no one seemed to be suffering at the end - a lovely, challenging ride - thanks all.</p>
