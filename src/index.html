                  6 started out, only 5 made it back!<br />
                  A lovely sunny day.<br />
                  Initial stage out on towpath to Greywell. various off road sections are connected with some road sections.<br />
                  The off road sections were 'challenging' and seem to become progressively worse, many sections churned up by 4x4s and off road motorbikes.<br />
                  About 17 miles into the ride, on one off road section...downhill, gully like, rock strewn...one of us ...(that'll be me, Andy), lost it and hit the deck hard, slamming into the rock floor. I was then grateful for the first aider training of others and I got the joys of an ambulance ride back to Basingstoke hospital - don't worry my bike was fine! :)<br />
                  The original ride was abandoned and the 5 riders made their way back to Fleet on the most direct route with a food stop and just one mechanical.<hr />

                  13:10 - 4 hrs 10 mins saw us at Hampton Court (32 miles), from here the Thames path is generally in good condition and wide, there are occassional pinch points and can be lots of people, especially in areas with Rowing clubs by the river. It felt as if we were in open countryside for the majority of the way.<br />
                  Progress slowed in the last 4 miles as the route sometimes left the river side and also the volume of people increased.<br />
                  16:15 - 7 hrs 15 mins, we arrived at Waterloo, hopped on a train and headed back to Fleet!<br />
                  17:40 - The train had us back in Fleet<br />

                  A very varied and mixture of surfaces, different and challenging, mostly dry and hardpacked.<br />

                  12:15 - Around 3 hrs 15 mins to Watts Gallery, 22 miles in. A lovely place to stop, the food and coffee was very good, but it took a while to arrive (an hour+).<br />
                  14:35 - 5 hrs 40 mins to Farnham....after several hills and then there was the climb out of Farnham!<br />

                  No major mechanicals<br />
                  It was good to see that folks were taking fuel and fluid onboard at every opportunity and it seemed to help, no one seemed to be suffering at the end - a lovely, challenging ride - thanks all.<hr />

                  NOTES:<br />
                  <p>Due to a Yellow weather warning for Sat 24/08, this was rescheduled to Sun 25/08.</p>
                  <p>09:00 Just one left from Fleet</p>
                  <p>09:30 (5.5 miles) A rendezvous at Ash Lock with Ally meant there were 2!</p>
                  <p>09:50 (9 miles) Frimley area and Spike was waiting for us, then there were 3!
                  The going was generally good, even after the previously days rain, the towpath did seem busier than usual, but that might well be due to the day before being a wash out.</p>
                  <p>18 miles in and we were at Woking ‚Ä¶I think it was new territory for Ally and Spike beyond this point</p>
                  <p>24 miles saw us in Weybridge and we were stood by the River Wey. We managed to convince Ally to press on to Hampton Court.  The scenery is pretty spectacular as we ride alongside the River Thames, the path is wider and there are more folks out and about.</p>
                  <p>12:30 (31 miles) and we arrived at Hampton Court. Locked the bikes and headed into ‚ÄòDish‚Äô (well worth a visit)‚Ä¶we sat in the rear courtyard area and enjoyed a great Full English at a reasonable price! The ride out did seem like tough going and the head wind was worse on the return journey!
                  As we rejoined the Basing Canal at Weybridge, sad to see 3 idiots (late teens/early 20s) with their fishing gear, but throwing stones/rocks across the canal at glass office build, they had cracked or smashed several large panes!</p>
                  <p>15:10 (44 miles) 2 of us played our ‚ÄòGet out of Jail‚Äô cards and opted for the train back. As we walked through the town, we helped a guy who was struggling to refit and pump up a tube/tyre.  He had the right stuff, but didn‚Äôt understand how his pump worked (I‚Äôd suggest that we all check and understand how to use the pumps we carry) and also couldn‚Äôt fit the new inner tube ‚Ä¶.we left him happy and busy pumping the tyre up.</p>
                  16:15 ‚Ä¶finally home.  Great riding companions and lovely views!<hr />

                  <p>We did the fiddly bit getting out of Guildford. Lots of help given to the tandem to lift and move it up/down steps and over gates.</p>
                  <p>George and Pauline (Tandem riders) dropped out for coffee at about 9 mile mark</p>
                  <p>The Super Six carried on ...although we had an unscheduled comfort stop at about 10 miles...the clock ticked on... and a few stops for pics ...we had to press on and hence were riding at around 11mph</p>
                  <p>10:50 (21 miles) we made it to the coffee stop at Southwater Country park</p>
                  <p>We headed to the beach! ...we had the mandatory puncture on the way</p>

                  For any that want to opt out, train stations at Guildford, Woking and Brookwood<hr />
                  NOTES:<br />  
                  09:00 Five started out<br />
                  09:15 The first ‚Äòfun thing‚Äô of the ride‚Ä¶a broken chain (Andy) ‚Ä¶quick link snapped and also a plate on another linked broken. No option but to head home ‚Ä¶.the rest headed to Poppys Caf√© (lucky them).  Replacement bike collected and arranged a meet point‚Ä¶we lost about 45 minutes! <br />
                  We lost the route up Caesars camp and ended up climbing Brick Hill‚Ä¶.not even Steve could ride it !<br />
                  Many of the tracks were wet and muddy, slowing progress.<br />
                  It was similar as we headed down Old Park Lane, many muddy patches.<br />
                  The situation continued as we climbed and descended, water and mud, making it difficult to maintain any reasonable speed and difficult to get traction on climbs.<br />
                  13:00 (20 miles, 4 hours) Arrived in Guildford, where we follow the rules and walked down ‚ÄúPorridge Pot Alley‚Äù only to get shouted at by an older women ‚Ä¶.as she was late and in a hurry! ‚Ä¶..maybe she was the White Rabbit?<br />
                  The Caf√© had a reasonable selection, we all stocked up!<br />
                  13:45 Left the caf√© and headed back out on the route. Steve decided to be sensible (very strange ‚Ä¶lol ) and get the train back and protect his dodgy knee‚Ä¶so then there were 4 of us.<br />
                  The Wey navigation track was narrow, rutted, muddy, wet and slow going ! Along the route we had a chain off (Neil) ‚Ä¶and a fall into nettles (Karen) ‚Ä¶.then issues with cramp set in for Spike.<br />
                  We stopped at pub in Send (approx 30 miles) and Spike got crisps (for the salt), Neil opted out and headed home by road, then there were THREE ! Spike was suffering and we needed frequent breaks.<br />
                  Just along from the pub, there was a tree down across the path and we had to clamber over.<br />
                  Another few miles on and we found the path blocked by a herd cows ‚Ä¶we had to navigate through and around<br />
                  16:00 (32 miles, 7 hours) ‚Ä¶12 miles from Guildford we finally joined the Basingstoke Canal<br />
                  16:55 (36 miles, nearly 8 hours) At Woking we cut our losses and caught a train ! ‚Ä¶a very eventful day!<br />
                  17:25 ‚Ä¶ish finally home ! Neil had punctured on his road journey home. So we all had had issues on the day! ‚Ä¶.but the sun was out, the weather was good, great company and all seemed to enjoy!<br /> 
                  Note for next year‚Ä¶run this event earlier in the year to avoid the mud!<br />
                  <br />After the ride we found out that Steve had been busy getting his money's worth out of his train ticket...having got from Guildford to Woking ...he then got on a train back to Guildford.....just to do the Guildford to Woking section again ! ...Doh !<hr />

                  09:30 Start...well for 5 of us ...for Steve this proved 'challenging' ..lol....<br />
                  We shared our live location as we were also meeting up with a new rider (Hi Jeico). We found Jeico at Ash lock and headed onwards.<br />
                  Steve finally caught up with us just after Mytchett Canal boat centre (about 9 miles!)...and seemed a tad out of breath ...lol! he'd been chasing for 50 mins!<br />
                  Just before getting to Woking, we had a minor mechanical ....a loose quick release allowed a rear wheel to drop out and lock up!<br />
                  The mandatory pic of H.G. Wells taken and then to the Cafe.<br />
                  The return journey was uneventful with various folks peeling off at points suitable to them with 4 of us arriving back in Fleet.  The weather was ideal and a pleasant temp!<br /><hr />

                  <p>A point to note, when in the autumn/winter/spring periods ...there is likely to be more mud, hence knobbly tyres give more grip!</p>

                  <p>Depending on the time of year and the length of the longer rides, it is recommended to have a set of front and rear lights and certainly use front and rear mudguards when it's wet/muddy ...so most of the year! LOL</p>

                      <li>A helmet - riding off road there are often low branches. We advise that a helmet is worn. If you need to borrow one, we might be able to help.</li>

                      <li>Padded cycling gloves - reduces vibration in you hands.</li>

                  <p>Although we plan to stop along the ride at a cafe, it is highly recommended you carry the following:</p>
                  Fluids - 1 or 2 bottles (as large as will fit on your bike). These can be filled with water,  juice, or an energy drink. If you don't have room on your bike, consider using a small backpack with a couple of bottles or a hydration pack.
                  <p>Also, ensure you top these up along the route when you have an opportunity. Remember, if you start to feel thirsty you are already starting to dehydrate.</p>
                  <p>Foods - It is a good idea always to have some form of emergency rations to hand. These can be energy/oat bars or simple things like Jelly Babies or Haribos.</p>
                  <p>Note - that well-trained athletes can only carry up to 90 minutes of energy supplies in their bodies and you see them regularly eating and drinking.</p>
