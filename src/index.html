                    <p>The off road sections were 'challenging' and seem to become progressively worse, many sections churned up by 4x4s and off road motorbikes.</p>
                    <p>About 17 miles into the ride, on one off road section...downhill, gully like, rock strewn...one of us ...(that'll be me, Andy), lost it and hit the deck hard, slamming into the rock floor.  I was then grateful for the first aider training of others and I got the joys of an ambulance ride back to Basingstoke hospital - don't worry my bike was fine! :)</p>
                    <p>The original ride was abandoned and the 5 riders made their way back to Fleet on the most direct route with a food stop and just one mechanical.</p>

                    <p>13:10 - 4 hrs 10 mins saw us at Hampton Court (32 miles), from here the Thames path is generally in good condition and wide, there are occassional pinch points and can be lots of people, especially in areas with Rowing clubs by the river.  It felt as if we were in open countryside for the majority of the way.</p>
                    <p>Progress slowed in the last 4 miles as the route sometimes left the river side and also the volume of people increased.</p>
                    <p>16:15 - 7 hrs 15 mins, we arrived at Waterloo, hopped on a train and headed back to Fleet!</p>
                    <p>17:40 - The train had us back in Fleet</p>
                    <p>Overall average 10mph, 57 miles logged</p>
                    <p>A great adventure for the day!</p>

                  For more experienced riders they tend to know what they can ride on.
                  <p>A point to note, when in the autumn/winter/spring periods ...there is likely to be more mud, hence knobbly tyres give more grip!</p>

                  <p>Although we plan to stop along the ride at a cafe, it is highly recommended you carry the following:</p>
                  Fluids - 1 or 2 bottles (as large as will fit on your bike). These can be filled with water,  juice, or an energy drink. If you don't have room on your bike, consider using a small backpack with a couple of bottles or a hydration pack.
                  <p>Also, ensure you top these up along the route when you have an opportunity. Remember, if you start to feel thirsty you are already starting to dehydrate.</p>
                  <p>Foods - It is a good idea always to have some form of emergency rations to hand. These can be energy/oat bars or simple things like Jelly Babies or Haribos.</p>
                  <p>Note - that well-trained athletes can only carry up to 90 minutes of energy supplies in their bodies and you see them regularly eating and drinking.</p>
                  <p>If in doubt just ask in the <a href="#contact-us" class="brand-text">WhatsApp Group</a> chat.</p>
